This is the text of a sample conference social media/blogging policy 
for conferences that may touch upon topics that make people feel
vulnerable. It's designed to help people feel safer in sharing their 
views openly and frankly. It can be adapted to suit your particular
conference however you'd like.

For more in-depth information, including background on the problem
and information about why a blogging policy might be necessary,

SAMPLE POLICY

(conference) attendees need the freedom to say controversial things
without worrying about their statements becoming public without their
permission. To that end, (we did not invite any outside press or
reporters, and) no one is allowed to publicly attribute your comments 
to you unless you give them express permission.

We do want to spread the word about what happened at (conference), so
that everyone can benefit and to make future conferences more 
successful. We strongly encourage writing about or telling people about 
(conference) sessions on blogs, social media, news stories, and other 
media as long as posters follow these rules:

* No attribution without permission: You can write about what people said but not who said it unless you have explicit permission from the speaker(s).

* Each session can decide to adopt different rules (e.g., always public, or always private) as long as it informs all participants who join the session.

* Please do not "live tweet" sessions excessively - it can make people feel like they are speaking in public, and it distracts other people.
