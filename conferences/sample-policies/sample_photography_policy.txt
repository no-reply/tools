This is the text of a sample conference photography policy for
conferences that are concerned about preventing harassing photography.
It can be adapted to suit your particular conference however you'd like.

For more in-depth information, including background on the problem
and information about why a photography policy might be necessary,

SAMPLE POLICY

Do not photograph, video, or audio record anyone at (conference) without
their express permission, explicitly sought or given in advance. Most
attendees will have (some visible marker) showing their preference for
photography or recording:

Green: Photographs always okay
Yellow: Ask before photographing
Red: Photographs never okay, don't ask

If no (marker) is visible, assume "ask before photographing."
