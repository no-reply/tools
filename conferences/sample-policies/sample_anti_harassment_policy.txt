This is the text of a sample conference anti-harassment policy to
serve as a starting place for your conference or event to adopt.

For more in-depth information, including internal policies for 
conference staff, suggestions on how to modify the policies for
conferences in which higher-risk material is on topic, and resources 
on how to advocate for adopting an anti-harassment policy, see the 
Geek Feminism wiki, located at:

SHORT VERSION:

$CONFERENCE is dedicated to a harassment-free conference experience for 
everyone. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at:

[URL for full anti-harassment policy]


MEDIUM VERSION:

$CONFERENCE is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference 
experience for everyone [, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, 
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion [insert 
any other specific concerns here]]. We do not tolerate harassment of 
conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is 
not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference 
participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from 
the conference [without a refund] at the discretion of the conference 
organizers. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at:

LONG VERSION:

[Insert medium public version of policy here.]

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments [related to gender, 
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, 
race, religion, [your specific concern here]], sexual images in 
public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, 
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks 
or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome 
sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior 
are expected to comply immediately.

[Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar 
activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In 
particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, 
or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use 
sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized 
environment.]

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference 
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including 
warning the offender or expulsion from the conference [with no refund]. 
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, 
or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff 
immediately. [Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts/special 
badges/head sets.]

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue 
security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist 
those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the 
conference. We value your attendance.

[Email address for organizers]
[Phone number for conference security or organizers]
[Phone number for hotel/venue security]
[Local law enforcement]
[Local sexual assault hot line]
[Local emergency and non-emergency medical]
[Local taxi company]

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues 
and conference-related social events.

This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the 
Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.

This policy is based on several other policies, including the Ohio 
LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth 
Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie 
Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and 
added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and 
other groups contributed to this work.
